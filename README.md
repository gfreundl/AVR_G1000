AVR code for my G1000 HID unit 

The G1000 is the most popular glass cockpit system in the GA fleet.  
The 3D model is based on the original device, has accurate dimensions and is available in STP format.  
All inputs are read by three ATMega16 MCU with USB firmware, linked together on a FE1.1 USB Hub chip.  

This code is mainly based on the V-USB driver firmware from obdev/v-usb
